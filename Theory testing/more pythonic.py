for _ in range (3):
    print("Hello")

#if there is no use of a iteration variable other than looping. 
# -you can just give "_" as the iteration value.

#---------------------------

#you can use multiply symbol to print something 3 times instead of using a for loop like code above
#this is called string multiplication
print("Hello\n" *3,end = "") #end= "" prevents blank line at the end
