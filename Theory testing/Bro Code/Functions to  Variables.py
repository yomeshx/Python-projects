#functions are also works as objects in python

def hello ():       #Function hello
    print("Hello World")


#'()' use to call a function, name itself is the function object. so you can assign it by using the name without the '()'

greet = hello       #assigning hello function to a variable

greet()             #then you can use that variable to call the assigned function by variable name
