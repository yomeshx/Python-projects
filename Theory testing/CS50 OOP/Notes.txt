You can create a class using Class keyword but anytime use the class you are creating an object

# __init__ is a instance method. 
    you define this method when you want to initialize contents of a object from a class.
    * these __init__ function is called automatically by python for you
# Self give you access to the current object you just created


#** When you should create a class in your code ? 
    when you want to represent a real world or fantasy world entity . like a student,car

#classes make big coding projects well organized. 
    for example imagine there is a entity called student , we can put everything including variables,functions related to Student in to a Student class
    -instead of bunch of functions everywhere making the code untidy
