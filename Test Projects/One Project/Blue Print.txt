How this game works,
    a cassino game that you can enter some amount of money and let you bet countless times
-until either players deposit amount ran out or player chose to quit playing and withdraw
-his/her prize.game has limited the range of 
 if  choose 

To get the deposit amount from the user

1.Make a function
    1.use a while loop
    2.ask amount and store it in a variable
    3.check if the amount is a number not a string
    4.check if the amount is not 0
    5.if the amount is valid . then break the while loop
    6.return the amount
    (so whole point of this function is to ask user for an input until
    -he/she gives a valid amount and then returning that amount)
